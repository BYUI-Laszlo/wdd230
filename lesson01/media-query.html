                Book of Mormon - 1 Nephi 3:7
            </h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father:
                 I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded,
                  for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the
                   children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them 
                   that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
            </p>

            <h2>Book of Mormon - Omni 9</h2>
            <p>Now I, Chemish, write what few things I write, in the same
                 book with my brother; for behold, I saw the last which 
                 he wrote, that he wrote it with his own hand; and he 
                 wrote it in the day that he delivered them unto me. 
                 And after this manner we keep the records, for it is 
                 according to the commandments of our fathers. And I make an end.
